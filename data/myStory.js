      In 2016, I was attempting to get an online appointment with the german
      consulat in Rabat to apply for stduent visa. Back then every thing was
      smooth excpet taht appointment, after just couple of seconds all the
      available appointmend listed on the consulat website g'one', this problem
      had last roughly a month without success. In the same period, I was
      self-teaching myself HTML on the famous french platform OPENCLASSROM, it
      offered a free HTML course.

      The knowledge that I had gained during my learnig journey, helped my to
      figure out on my own how to prefill the required fileds in advance and
      remove the annoying captcha. Since then my passion for web development has
      borned and I dopted as my hobby until 2019 when I decided to make the web
      and mobile development as a professional carrer.
